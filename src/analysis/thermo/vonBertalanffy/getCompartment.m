function [compartments, uniqueCompartments] = getCompartment(mets)
% Gets the compartment for each metabolite, and the unique compartments,
% from metabolite abbreviation(s), each of which must have compartment
% symbol concatentated on the right hand side (i.e. `metAbbr[*]`).
%
% USAGE:
%
%    [compartments, uniqueCompartments] = getCompartment(mets)
%
% INPUT:
%    mets:               char array with a single metabolite abbreviation
%                           or 
%                           `m x 1` cell array of metabolite abbreviations 
%                           
% OUTPUTS:
%    compartments:          char array with a single compartment identifier
%                           or 
%                           `m x 1` cell array of compartment identifiers
%
%    uniqueCompartments:    char array with a single compartment identifier
%                           or
%                           cell array of unique compartment identifiers
