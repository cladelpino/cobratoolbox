# MOOMIN
MOOMIN (Mathematical explOration of Omics data on a MetabolIc Network) is a tool for analysing differential expression data. It takes as its input a metabolic network and the results of a DE analysis: a posterior probability of differential expression and a (logarithm of a) fold change for a list of genes.
It then forms a hypothesis of a metabolic shift, determining for each reaction its status as "increased flux",
"decreased flux", or "no change". These are expressed as colours: red for an increase, blue for a decrease, and grey for no
change. See the paper for full details: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz584

# Dependencies
MOOMIN runs in Matlab (developed in R2016a) and relies on the COBRA Toolbox (developed with v2.0, tested with v3.0). Additionally, a MILP-solver compatible with
COBRA is needed (currently only IBM CPLEX is supported).

# Usage
In order to use MOOMIN, you need DE results obtained using Bayesian methods. In other words, a posterior probability of differential expression (PPDE) is needed instead of the more common p-value.
You also need a metabolic network of the organism under study. You can read an SBML-file (.xml) using the COBRA-function
"readSBML" or you can download a Matlab-structure containing a COBRA model directly if one is available.

With genome-scale models, the MILP problem created by MOOMIN can become difficult to solve. If you are running into trouble, consider switching off stoichiometry ('stoichiometry', 0). You can also try passing these custom solver parameters to MOOMIN using the 'solverParameters' option:
tolerance = 1e-6;
solverParameters.intTol = tolerance;
solverParameters.absMipGapTol = tolerance;
solverParameters.feasTol = tolerance;
solverParameters.optTol = tolerance;
solverTimeLimit = 1000;
solverPrintLevel = 0;
