1. Better way to avoid numerical problem
2. dense vs sparse matrix operation (automatically switch between them)
3. Demos showing how to use sample.m
-Sample cube.
-Sample netlib.
-Sample bio polytope.
-Sample a Gaussian.
4. Create a observer
5. better Printout
6. 16 samples at the same time? Better use of SIMD.
7. Better presolve
Consider rows of matrix A.
If there are two rows such that
the non-zeros in row i is a subset of the non-zeros in row j.
Then, we should row operation to remove one entry in row j.
But one thing we must do, at ver 0.2 is at least do row-operations for rows
of 2 non-zeros.
I find that bio polytope, majority of rows has this. So, it can be a real
benefit.
8. Should we incorporate the test of correctness and mixing time?
9. include CHAR?
10. Sometimes splitDenseCols slow down the runtime!
11. Linear system with PCG?
12. There are many dataset in http://miplib.zib.de/set_benchmark.html
13. Create a test for sampling from other distribution.
    (At least from Guassian...)
14. metropolis hastings filter
1. have quad for presolve
2. Whenever Linear System Solver failed, we can switch to quad
